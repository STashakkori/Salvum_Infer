# Salvum_Infer
Infer modified during Salvum development. Supports more archive types. Hope this gets incorporated back into the original:
https://github.com/bojand/infer/tree/master

Supports additional archive types such as lzma, lzop. I think lz and cpio were already implemented, but don't think
they were working as expected. If they are, I apologize but wrote and tested new functions in archive.rs so check them out.

Thank you Bojan and collaborators from $t@$h
